Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. It’s stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos don’t do it justice.
"No problem. Snow and ice tend to slide off the Tesla SolarGlass due to lower surface roughness, so accumulates less than a normal roof. Even so, it’s very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles."

"Static fire data looks good so far. This is first launch of Falcon Heavy Block 5, so we’re being extra cautious. Launch date might move."
"“drivers in this dataset use Autopilot for 34.8% of their driven miles, and yet appear to maintain a relatively high degree of functional vigilance.”"
Stay positive 🧁
Starhopper completed tethered hop. All systems green.
This is way more awesome than it might sound

"Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 & HW3. Going forward “HW3” will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important."
That’s exactly it. You’re no longer mentally fatigued after a long drive. Makes a major difference to your happiness level commuting home from work after a long day.
Hard to appreciate how much Tesla Autopilot improves enjoyment of driving until you try it

"Atmospheric entry at 17,000 mph is like a meteor & will vaporize steel. Burn marks below are on cold side. Main heatshield on bottom."
"Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from 135kW to 250+kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case & more than 2 for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput."
"Latest software improves Tesla Supercharger times by up to 25% for all Tesla S/X/3 worldwide, incl original 2012 Model S. Not splitting power across 2 Supercharger stalls helps all cars up to 50%."
Extremely important merch
Russia has excellent rocket engineering & best engine currently flying. Reusable version of their new Angara rocket would be great.

"In other words, you may be able to get a Tesla before the $7500 US tax credit drops in 2 weeks, even if you haven’t placed an order yet"
Zero Suit 😉
💕🍜 ramen is sooo good🍜 💕
"Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get 3 days to return for full refund vs 1 day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)"
"Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in 3 weeks. 

To be on the cancellation waitlist for delivery this year or if you want a display car, order at   or visit our stores. Full refund if Tesla can’t deliver your car this year."
"Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself, even if they don’t believe in climate change. 

Not everyone can be convinced about global warming, but if an electric car is simply the best product, they don’t need to be."
"We’re opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year, including Knoxville. Tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week."
"Already testing traffic lights, stop signs & roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all."

"If you have a Tesla built in past 2 years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars & takes highway interchanges & off-ramps."
"Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldn’t exist or would have started much later."
"Tesla history trivia: we didn’t actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He’d originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later."
Boring Company product launch on Dec 18. More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars & ground to tunnel car elevators.
Tracking shot of Falcon water landing
"Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon."

"Um, that is not our castle. I just found a picture on the Internet."
Not much but it is ours
The Boring Company is building a watchtower in LA out of dirt bricks & we need a knight to yell insults at people in a French accent
"Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe & Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently."
"Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, it’s better to use trucks. Single load/unload & direct to owner location."
Tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure Model 3 can be delivered in US by Dec 31 if ordered by Nov 30

"That is true & should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term."
"We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel & have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now & avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong & oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far"
"Good, but not hospital grade. S & X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid & alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model 3."
"If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S & X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people."

Walked full length of Boring Co tunnel under LA tonight. Disturbingly long. On track for opening party Dec 10. Will be very one-dimensional.
We didn’t even have kids back then. Just little sponges.
Kids these days have it easy
I remember when I was a sponge. Simpler times they were.
First movie I ever saw in theaters
When the only existing life was a sponge
Although it was in the precambrian era
Star Wars only had an $11M budget. Must have been in the galaxy of ridiculously low budgets.

What they do should be illegal
The last several years have taught me that they are indeed reasonably maligned
"By revenue, taking publicly available selling prices, Model 3 actually outsold Camry by a factor of two"
"People sometimes forget that a company is just a group of people gathered together to make products. So long as it makes great products, it will have great value."
Just want to that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point!
Great verdict 😀

Good idea ...
Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front & a motor in rear. One is optimized for power & one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination & don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec & top speed to 140 mph.
"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker & with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."
"Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3:
3.5 sec  0-60mph 
155 mph Top Speed
310 mile Range"
Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself & zero paperwork.

What’s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
"It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage"
Lovely story

"Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising & no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0."
"The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter"
"The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors"

"But wait, there’s more: the flamethrower is sentient, its safe word is “cryptocurrency” and it comes with a free blockchain"
You’d need millions of zombies for a so-called “apocalypse” anyway. Where would I even get a factory big enough to make so many!?
The rumor that I’m secretly creating a zombie apocalypse to generate demand for flamethrowers is completely false
Unless you like fun
"Obviously, a flamethrower is a super terrible idea. Definitely don’t buy one."
"1,000 ordered already, only 19,000 left!"
"When the zombie apocalypse happens, you’ll be glad you bought a flamethrower. Works against hordes of the undead or your money back!"
Don’t do this
Great for roasting nuts 🔥 🥜

Falcon Heavy launching from same @NASA pad as the Saturn V Apollo 11 moon rocket. It was 50% higher thrust with five F-1 engines at 7.5M lb-F. I love that rocket so much.
Max thrust at lift-off is 5.1 million pounds or 2300 metric tons. First mission will run at 92%.

I do have one question. What does GoDaddy mean?
Fixed. Now it's good.

Going over the small nuances of Model 3 production. Very important that nothing sounds tinny.

"You can now drive anywhere in the US (except N Alaska), most of Europe, China & Japan using the Tesla Supercharger network!"

Production unit 1 of Model 3 is now built and going through final checkout. Pics soon.
Stop biting my finger dammit
This will be the highest power battery system in the world by a factor of 3. Australia rocks!!
"Thanks @INTELSAT! Really proud of the rocket and SpaceX team today. Min apogee requirement was 28,000 km, Falcon 9 achieved 43,000 km."
SpaceX team reviewed all systems again late last night. Done our best to ensure all is good.
Wanted to say thanks to all that own or ordered a Tesla. It matters to us that you took a risk on a new car company. We won't forget.
"Looks like we can reach 20,000 Model 3 cars per month in Dec"
"Handover party for first 30 customer Model 3's on the 28th! Production grows exponentially, so Aug should be 100 cars and Sept above 1500."
Model 3 passed all regulatory requirements for production two weeks ahead of schedule. Expecting to complete SN1 on Friday
Norway is awesome
Another SpaceX launch today if weather is good
Sorry to hear about China launch failure today. I know how painful that is to the people who designed & built it.

Just installed steel skeleton of the car/pod elevator. Should be operating next week.

Because it's off the wall
And I don't care who knows it. Our love will never die.
Just try one. It's way better than you think.
Not as much as tunnels though
They are so underappreciated
They will never let you down

No longer waiting for Godot. It has begun boring and just completed the first segment of tunnel in LA.
"Good summary of rocket landing history. There were two successful water landings much earlier, but they didn't survive long."
Sped up version of today's rocket landing on the Droneship Just Read the Instructions (guess it
New titanium grid fins worked even better than expected. Should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service.
Launch at 1:25 delivering 10 satellites for Iridium. Droneship repositioned due to extreme weather. Will be tight.
"Closeup of the titanium grid fins. Not painted, as they glow red hot during a fast reentry."

Flying with larger & significantly upgraded hypersonic grid fins. Single piece cast & cut titanium. Can take reentry heat with no shielding.
"Rocket is extra toasty and hit the deck hard (used almost all of the emergency crush core), but otherwise good"
Falcon 9 will experience its highest ever reentry force and heat in today's launch. Good chance rocket booster doesn't make it back.
"In life, there are no easy choices"
Do want irony on social media?
Must remember that irony and social media are not friends. Keep forgetting. Dammit.
Over 1000 km should be possible in a 100D with the right tires

No need to rely on scientists for global warming -- just use a thermometer
If schedule holds there will be two Falcon 9 launches within 48 hours (Cape & Vandenberg) this weekend
"Postponing launch to replace fairing pneumatic valve. It is dual redundant, but not worth taking a chance."
"Promising conversations with @MayorOfLA regarding tunnel network that would carry cars, bikes & pedestrians. Permits harder than technology."

Promising early results from the Ludricrous Easter egg. Looks like 0 to 60 mph in 2.34 sec (Motor Trend spec) might be achievable...
Tesla's approach to building an autonomy platform is focused on high compute efficiency machine learning. Primarily vision w radar & sonar.
"If all looks good, HW2 Autopilot functionality will switch from shadow to active mode by end of week for cars beyond initial 1000"
New rev for Autopilot HW2 rolling out Mon to first 1000 & to rest of fleet in shadow mode. Also improves HW1 and enables Ludicrous+.
Hold-down firing of @SpaceX Falcon 9 at Vandenberg Air Force completed. All systems are go for launch next week.
HW2 Autopilot software uploading to 1000 cars this eve. Will then hold to verify no field issues and upload to rest of fleet next week.
"Resolving an Autopilot HW2 bug that shows up when booting from a subzero cold-soak. If that fix works, software will start uploading tmrw."

Can be turned on or off. V8.1 will allow always-on min and max temps to be set.
Tesla keeps temp below 40C/105F by automatically venting cabin & turning on AC when needed. Can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.
This is a major overhaul on almost every level compared to V7.
"V8.0 starts downloading tonight. Release will be gradual to make sure there aren't small regressions. Many car configs, many environments."
Preview of the @SpaceX interplanetary transport system at @IAC2016
"Maybe Ultimate Spaceship, Version 2? Mostly because it is not the ultimate and there isn't a version 1."

Loss of Falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation. Originated around upper stage oxygen tank. Cause still unknown. More soon.
We need to do one more minor rev on 8.0 and then will go to wide release in a few weeks

Can't wait to see all three cores of Falcon Heavy come back for landings! First two will be almost simultaneous.
Landing
Bit of a distraction yesterday. Working on plan today.
Out on LZ-1. We just completed the post-landing inspection and all systems look good. Ready to fly again.
Falcon on LZ-1 at Cape Canaveral
"Tesla customers are v smart & don't want media speaking on their behalf abt Autopilot. Recent poll: 0.0% want it disabled -- not 0.1%, 0.0%."
Great rebuttal by a Tesla owner to those calling for Autopilot to be disabled. Was written with zero input from us.
Except for the tweet about large amounts of crack (actually just small amounts)
Not easy to convey irony in a tweet
Finishing off the plan while listening to the soundtrack from Gatsby. Seems appropriate...
"Will be working at Tesla on Autopilot & Model 3 today, then aiming to pull an all-nighter and complete the master product plan"

Have to focus on tonight's @SpaceX launch. Will post Tesla (master) product plan afterwards.
"Btw, want to thank both Bosch and MobilEye for their help and support in making Autopilot better. Please direct all criticism at Tesla."
"Promising call today with @BoschGlobal, maker of our radar sensor. Looks like significant improvements possible via OTA software update."
Sensible article on Autopilot by @the guardian
Sunday is the end of the week :)
Our radar is using a wavelength of 3.9mm. A good size for both decent resolution and rain penetration. Am hopeful...
"Good thing about radar is that, unlike lidar (which is visible wavelength), it can see through rain, snow, fog and dust"
yes

"Onboard vehicle logs show Autopilot was turned off in Pennsylvania crash. Moreover, crash would not have occurred if it was on."
EU regulators find no safety concerns with Autopilot
We don't mind taking the heat for customer safety. It is the right thing to do. From @RoadandTrack
"Tesla finishes last in being salesy! Good. Also, I can't believe there is a real Pied Piper."
Something like that
Kinda. Creating a seamlessly integrated Tesla battery & solar power product that looks beautiful is the reason

"We *def* don't recommended this, but Model S floats well enough to turn it into a boat for short periods of time. Thrust via wheel rotation."
Tesla owner drives through a flooded tunnel & out the other side
"As mentioned at the beginning of the year, I'm expecting ~70% success rate on landings for the year. 2016 is the year of experimentation."
Looks like early liquid oxygen depletion caused engine shutdown just above the deck
"Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought, but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines"
Thanks Tyler
Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.
Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.
RUD = Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly :)
Looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.

"And, no, I'm not an alien...but I used to be one"
Latest science predicts > trillion alien civilizations. Either they don't last long or there are a *lot* of aliens
Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed. Q is why?
"Of greater concern: 37 of 40 suspension complaints to NHTSA were fraudulent, i.e. false location or vehicle identification numbers were used"
NHTSA confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the Model S suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter
Nice comment about the Model S by CvK on @TopGear_BBCA
Something about a flying metal suit...
S and X cells are also Panasonic
Would like to clarify that Tesla is working exclusively with Panasonic for Model 3 cells. News articles claiming otherwise are incorrect.

Fast replay of today's rocket landing on SpaceX droneship OCISLY
Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
"Rocket landing speed was close to design max & used up contingency crush core, hence back & forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping."
"Satellite deployed to 91,000 km apogee. All looks good."

"Yeah, this was a three engine landing burn, so triple deceleration of last flight. That's important to minimize gravity losses."
May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar
Woohoo!!
"Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way"
"Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible, but I'd recommend ordering a Model 3 soon if you want 2018 delivery"
Filtering particulates from air makes a significant & measurable diff to health. Wd like to credit Larry Page with turning me on to this.
Bioweapon Defense Mode is real   This is what happens when you turn it on:
Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.

Should mention that Tesla Motors itself had nothing to do with the short movie. This was completely independent.

My job moonlighting as a police officer in Brazil is no longer secret

"My best guess for 2016: ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in 2017"
"Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it"
"If speed at stage separation > ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h."
Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
"As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude & distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed."
"Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing."
"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing."
"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating & rotating."
Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.

Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
"As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude & distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed."
"Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing."
"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing."
"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating & rotating."
Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
"Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations."
Next launch is a @NASA science mission from VAFB California on Sunday.
Aiming to launch this weekend and (hopefully) land on our droneship. Ship landings needed for high velocity missions
Sad to hear that David Bowie died. He was amazing.
"In ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land & not blocked by borders, eg you're in LA and the car is in NY"
"Tap your phone or key and your car will open the garage door, exit, close the door and come to you. Will do same in reverse for unsummon."
First baby step in Tesla Summon capability now downloading over-the-air with V7.1
"Worth reading The Machine Stops, an old story by E. M. Forster"

Background on the launch
Launch & landing can be seen on the   webcast or in person from Cape Canaveral public causeway at 8:33pm local tmrw
Just reviewed mission params w SpaceX team. Monte Carlo runs show tmrw night has a 10% higher chance of a good landing. Punting 24 hrs.

Meant to reply to this article:
This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.
"Static fire test looks good. Pending data review, will aim to launch Sunday."
Rounding up to 1 sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence
Aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side valve. Adjusting ignition sequence by 0.6 secs for next attempt.
About 2 mins from static fire
Abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. Adjusting thresholds and restarting count at T-10 mins.
5 mins from static fire test
Falcon 9 is vertical on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Working towards static fire. Deep cryo liquid oxygen presenting some challenges.
Vance article on self-driving cars was inaccurate

Good summary of my talk in Paris on climate change
About to give a talk at the Sorbonne
"But credit for 1st reusable suborbital rocket goes to X-15  
And Burt Rutan for commercial"
Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL flight began 2013. Orbital water landing 2014. Orbital land landing next.
"Getting to space needs ~Mach 3, but GTO orbit requires ~Mach 30. The energy needed is the square, i.e. 9 units for space and 900 for orbit."
"It is, however, important to clear up the difference between ""space"" and ""orbit"", as described well by"
Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster
Should mention that I will be interviewing people personally and Autopilot reports directly to me. This is a super high priority.
We are looking for hardcore software engineers. No prior experience with cars required. Please include code sample or link to your work.
"Ramping up the Autopilot software team at Tesla to achieve generalized full autonomy. If interested, contact autopilot@teslamotors.com."

Tesla P85D (assembled in Tilburg) beats 650 hp MacLaren from 0 to 150km/h in Dutch magazine test
"Regarding the watch, Jony & his team created a beautiful design, but the functionality isn't compelling yet. By version 3, it will be."
"Yo, I don't hate Apple. It's a great company with a lot of talented people. I love their products and I'm glad they're doing an EV."
Peak temp increases due to climate change
Mostly accurate and fun movie about Mars. Worth seeing.

Both satellites deployed on target. Now firing their ion thrusters to reach geo station over Europe & Asia.

Excellent and funny intro article about Artificial Superintelligence! Highly recommend reading
Tesla Model S rated by @ConsumerReports as best car in world for 2nd year in a row
Landing on a stormy sea
Rocket soft landed in the ocean within 10m of target & nicely vertical! High probability of good droneship landing in non-stormy weather.
Primary mission on target. Spacecraft head towards the sun! All good there.
Planning a significant upgrade of the droneship for future missions to handle literally anything. Maybe give it a Merlin for good measure :)
Can't delay any longer. Must proceed with primary mission to launch the Deep Space Climate Observatory spacecraft.
Maybe this is all the work of the Stonecutters! Certainly connects a lot of themes ...

Dragon splashdown off the California coast
"Launch postponed to tomorrow due to high winds at the Cape, but Dragon still inbound from orbit in 90 mins"
Extreme wind shear over Cape Canaveral. Feels like a sledgehammer when supersonic in the vertical. Hoping it changes
"""What Are The Civilian Applications?"""
"Prob good though. Will give us time to replace 1st stage video transmitter (not needed for launch, but nice to have)."
Air Force tracking radar went down. Launch postponed to same time tomorrow.
Rocket reentry will be much tougher this time around due to deep space mission. Almost 2X force and 4X heat. Plenty of hydraulic fluid tho.
"Launching our 1st deep space mission today. Headed to Earth-Sun L1 gravity null point at 1M miles, 4X further than moon."
"If you are curious about the P85D, you can schedule a test drive here:"
Painting the name on the droneship ...
"P85 acceleration will also improve, but not quite as much"
Video made by owner of a P85D going up a 14% grade on snow passing a whole bunch of stuck SUVs
Tesla dual motor cars are also all-wheel drive. Main goal of dual motor was actually insane traction on snow. Insane speed was a side effect
Tesla P85D 0 to 60mph acceleration will improve by ~0.1 sec soon via over-the-air software update to inverter algorithm
"Great DragTimes video of people experiencing P85D ""Insane Mode"" acceleration for the first time"
Final one: anything launched by a railgun (if you could ever reach ~ Mach 27) would explode upon exiting the barrel in our dense atmosphere
"Ion thrusters are great, but have extremely tiny force (photon thruster even less). Must have more thrust than weight or you don't go up."
And pls don't ask me about space elevators  until someone at least builds a carbon nanotube structure longer than a footbridge

"Upcoming flight already has 50% more hydraulic fluid, so should have plenty of margin for landing attempt next month."
"Grid fins worked extremely well from hypersonic velocity to subsonic, but ran out of hydraulic fluid right before landing."
Didn't get good landing/impact video. Pitch dark and foggy. Will piece it together from telemetry and ... actual pieces.
Ship itself is fine. Some of the support equipment on the deck will need to be replaced...
"Rocket made it to drone spaceport ship, but landed hard. Close, but no cigar this time. Bodes well for the future tho."
Ascent phase good. Dragon deployed to Space Station rendezvous orbit.

"Bloomberg article today also has oddly false details. I don't eat breakfast at Tesla and drink coffee, not juice."
"The @MikeJudge show about Silicon Valley missed the mark in some ways, but I didn't hate it, as @Recode reporter claimed"
Some oddly inaccurate news stories of late ...
Review of Model S by @BBC_TopGear much appreciated

All known rocket anomalies resolved. Will spend another day rechecking to be sure. Launch attempt tmrw eve w Wed as backup.
"The gas generator is a small rocket engine that powers the turbopump, which produces 7000 horsepower & weighs 160 lbs"
Engines are cycling cleanly w ground pneumatics. Replaced gas generator on engine 9 (center) as a precautionary measure.
"Abort was caused by oxygen in ground side TEA-TEB. Upper stage on separate internal circuit, so doesn't face same risk."
"Rocket engines are healthy, but cleaning turbopump gas generators will take another day. Aiming for Mon eve launch."
We called manual abort. Better to be paranoid and wrong. Bringing rocket down to borescope engines ...
"If launch aborts, we will bring the rocket down for engine inspection, so probably a few days before next attempt"
"Increasing helium spin start pressure. Probably <50% chance of passing all aborts, but worth a try. Countdown resuming ..."
Launch aborted by autosequence due to slower than expected thrust ramp. Seems ok on closer inspection. Cycling countdown.

"...but only if you like your house ""Honda recalls Fit for fire risk, says park it outside   """
"Saw pressure fluctuations on Falcon boost stage liquid oxygen tank. Want to be super careful, so pushing launch to Thurs."
At Disney World w kids for traditional prelaunch visit (first good flight was after riding Space Mountain)
Launch can be viewed live from Cape causeways or via   webcast around 5:30 local time on Monday
"Will be toughest mission to date. Requires coast + upper stage restart + going to 80,000 km altitude (~1/4 way to moon)."
Headed to Cape Canaveral tomorrow for first @SpaceX geostationary satellite launch.
Tesla Model S Consumer Reports customer satisfaction survey highest of any car on road at 99/100
Tesla is also extending the Model S warranty to cover any fire damage even if due solely to a driver accident

"Why does a Tesla fire w no injury get more media headlines than 100,000 gas car fires that kill 100s of people per year?"

"Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money :)"
Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.

Tesla wired the funds to repay the DOE loan today. Only US car company to have fully repaid govt
"Me & other private money funded Tesla for first 7 years, got IPO+ govt money for 3, now paid back. Yes, carbon tax would be a better way."
"Weight of scientific evidence. Taxes don't ban a purchase, they just increase cost. Am against bans, except in extreme cases."
"Exactly. Better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome, instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. Let market decide."
"Perhaps. I am in favor of fair, simple taxes that are neutral on most things, incent good & disincent bad."
"Great article on Tesla-dealer battle by Leilani Munter (@CarbonFreeGirl), who lives in NC"
"And, since we will run out of oil anyway, why risk the future of all life on Earth simply to delay sustainable energy?"
Those who would deny climate change should ask themselves what happens if they are wrong
"More importantly, @Chrysler failed to pay back $1.3B. Apart those 2 points, you were totally 1st"

Petting zoo left a chicken behind at the park. Now we have a pet chicken.
Supercharger announcement pushed to next week. Something else this week.
"Btw, vast majority of credit for SolarCity should go to Lyndon & Peter Rive & their awesome team. I'm just a small part."
Improving service and honing manufacturing efficiency are the biggest short term challenges. Not sales constrained.
"Would also recommend the Cheese Shop, Spam or Fish License by Monty Python."

"Hold down voice button & say ""Play Amish Paradise by Weird Al Yankovic"". Model S can play almost any song via Internet."
There is a way for the Tesla Model S to be recharged throughout the country faster than you could fill a gas tank.
"Just want to say thanks to customers & investors that took a chance on Tesla through the long, dark night. We wouldn't be here without you."
"Am a fan of Larry, Sergey & Google in general, but self-driving cars comments to Bloomberg were just off-the-cuff. No big announcement here"
"Tesla priority is electrification of cars, so priority is Model S, Model X, then mass market third gen vehicle & truck"
"Creating an autopilot for cars at Tesla is an important, but not yet top priority. Still a few years from production."
"Anyone interested in doing ultra hardcore vehicle engineering at Tesla, please apply!"
Chris Porritt from Aston Martin just joined as head of vehicle engineering at Tesla

Yay for democracy! @latimes asks: Should Tesla Motors be able to sell directly to consumers?
Just wanted to say thanks to everyone for testifying yesterday in Austin. Will hang around after press conf to thank people in person.
Just had Texas BBQ for lunch in Capitol Building. About to head to House Committee hearing to advocate for Tesla in TX.
In TX to make the case for allowing Tesla to sell cars. Pls come to Capitol Room E2.014 at 1:30!
Which leads me to my next subject of gun control ... just kidding
No more political comments for me now that I've shot off both my feet.
"At the risk of losing more ""cool points"", I like Reagan too! However, I also like Obama, Clinton & JFK. Good people on both sides..."
"Always admired Margaret Thatcher -- she was tough, but sensible & fair, much like my English Nana"
New Tesla red going down assembly line for the first time. We spent a lot of time on this color!
"Sarah Palin calls Tesla a loser. Am deeply wounded.    Btw, Model S warranty does cover ""bricking""."

Am headed to TX next week to thank people personally for supporting Tesla. Please head to SB 1659 @ 8am tomorrow #TeslaTX
Certainly true that many people believe that Tesla and SpaceX are powered by the #hhgttg Infinite Improbability Drive :)
Today's Tesla announcement is actually the 2nd in a 5 part trilogy (love Douglas Adams)
"To be clear, Tesla is in California, so it is not April Fool's yet! Also, some may differ, but imo the Tues news is arguably more important."
First profitable Q for Tesla thanks to awesome customers & hard work by a super dedicated team
About to do chocolate egg hunt with all the kids. Candy bonanza! Happy Easter!
"Thanks Bob “@BobMetcalfe: Tesla Takes on TX Dealer's Association (MA too) - Repeal anti-competitive dealer laws -  """
"Sorry, correct link is:"
"If you support Tesla in Texas, please contact your state Senate or House member. Free enterprise!"
Auto dealers in Texas are trying to stop Tesla. Would appreciate your help in fighting for what's right
Rocket fairing almost ready for deployment test in vacuum chamber. Man lift on right for scale
Can't make this stuff up: “@ErneX: hah and that's the name of a fire extinguisher  ”
A123 battery company renames itself B456 after bankruptcy (really).
Recovery ship has secured Dragon. Powering down all secondary systems. Cargo looks A ok.

Telemetry says main parachutes deployed ... now visually confirmed
Recovery ship just heard the sonic booms from Dragon reentry and has data transmission lock.
Dragon deorbit burn was good. All thrusters operating. On target for splashdown.
"Future will indeed be rooftop solar + battery pack, w utility company just providing backup power"
Slight change of date to ensure no end of quarter distractions -- will be Tues next week.
Really exciting @TeslaMotors announcement coming on Thursday. Am going to put my money where my mouth is in v major way.
"There's crazy, there's batsh*t crazy, then there's North Korea crazy..."
.@jbmeicher Model S works great in cold. Highest sales/capita are in Norway and we have a ton of customers in Canada.
"But when considering savings of gas v electricity, true cost vs gas cars is more like $25k for a v sweet ride"
.@benmacy $30k in 2013 $ (ie + inflation) w 200+ mile range w some really cool tech that we can't talk about yet.
".@joshj777 It has always been my dream to produce a low cost, compelling electric car. We are 3 to 4 years away. Wish it could be sooner."
Review of Tesla Model S by @RoadandTrack. Good article w minor errors addressed in reader comments
"When Shoemaker-Levy comet hit Jupiter in 94, it made an Earth size hole. We wd be super dead if it actually hit Earth"
Probably true imo “@bbcscitech: Dinosaur-killing rock 'was a comet'  ”

Testing separation of F9 rocket fairing (can hold a city bus) in world's largest vacuum chamber
Craig Venter talks about flu vaccines and the Tesla Model S. Gesundheit!
The Johnny Cash hover slam!
Will show Johnny Cash hover slam rocket video for the first time in about 15 mins. Test footage only 36 hrs old. #SXSW
Check out Model S at Tesla Austin Gallery at The Domain opening today! I will stop by this eve and tomorrow morning.
Random trivia: my grandfather & great grandfather were both born in Minnesota. I was named after my GGF.
Minnesota auto dealers tried to pass legislation to block Tesla stores. Bill was just defeated in Senate. Thanks MN!
"Arrived Austin. Talking with TX House about creating an orbital launch complex near Brownsville, then #SXSW keynote tmrw"
Saw a play about Stalin in Norwegian. Like watching mimes with emoticons doing Solzhenitsyn.
Am in Oslo to thank the Norwegian customers of @TeslaMotors personally. Highest Model S orders per capita in the world.
Just received #Dragon docking clearance from @NASA. Will begin orbital maneuvers to Space Station at 11pm Pacific time.
Just want to say thanks to @NASA for being the world's coolest customer. Looking forward to delivering the goods!

Orbit raising burn successful. Dragon back on track.
Thruster pods one through four are now operating nominally. Preparing to raise orbit. All systems green.
Pods 1 and 4 now online and thrusters engaged. Dragon transitioned from free drift to active control. Yes!!
Attempting bring up of thruster pods 2 and 4
Solar array deployment successful
Thruster pod 3 tank pressure trending positive. Preparing to deploy solar arrays.
About to pass over Australia ground station and command inhibit override
Holding on solar array deployment until at least two thruster pods are active
Issue with Dragon thruster pods. System inhibiting three of four from initializing. About to command inhibit override.
Falcon 9 delivered Dragon to its target orbit. All good on the rocket.
T minus 22 mins to launch mission 3 to dock with the Space Station
Computer glitch found by @SpaceX avionics while bench testing on IM. Couldn't replicate on vehicle. Launch proceeding...
Launch on track for tomorrow morning at 10:10 am Cape Canaveral time
"One often hears that there is no point in a US carbon tax unless China acts. Well, they just did"
"Rocket static fire @SpaceX Cape Canaveral launch pad looks good. Engines generated 433 tons of thrust, parameters nominal."

Testing the Model S on a surface of pure ice and snow
"Btw, more free East Coast Superchargers coming soon. Will allow lower initial charge, v high speed trip & long detours, like NYTimes drive."
"Tesla data logging is only turned on with explicit written permission from customers, but after Top Gear BS, we always keep it on for media."
"Tesla blog coming soon detailing what actually happened on Broder's NYTimes ""range test"". Also lining up other journalists to do same drive."
NYTimes article about Tesla range in cold is fake. Vehicle logs tell true story that he didn't actually charge to max & took a long detour.
"Busted “@TheOnion: Barack Obama: 'Look, I'm Just Going To Say It: I Collect Antique Nazi Memorabilia'  ”"
Next Grasshopper rocket test is called the Johnny Cash Hover Slam (yeah baby!). Might be our first smoking crater...

My thoughts on the nature of the issue with the battery pack supplied to Boeing
Desire to help Boeing is real & am corresponding w 787 chief engineer. Junod's Esquire article had high fiction content.
"Maybe already under control, but Tesla & SpaceX are happy to help with the 787 lithium ion batteries."
What it feels like to ride a rocket
"To be super clear, I don't wish to (nor could I) mandate anything about a Mars Colony. Am just working on the tech to get people there."
"Also, I am not the kale eating overlord of Mars (altho kale has its moments)"
"Nice story about a Model S coast to coast road trip. By end of year, it will be Superchargers all the way!"
This gives a sense of what Mars would look like after changing the climate to sustain life
Death Valley restored to position of world's hottest place
CA's Death Valley is #1 again! Tesla hot weather testing was done there. Model S was fine but gas tow truck overheated.
Cowboy riding the rocket no problemo
Single camera view of the 40 meter rocket hover
Then we took him for a ride: 40 meter hover flight vid of the SpaceX Grasshopper test rocket
"To provide a little perspective on the size of Grasshopper, we added a 6 ft cowboy to the rocket"
Very much agree with this great review of Chasing Ice on Ars Technica

"Tesla articles 30 mins apart: ""This Stock is Screaming Buy""   and ""This Stock Could Get DESTROYED"""
Tesla was just approved for a full Class 1 Massachusetts Auto Sales License by a vote of 4 to 1. Much appreciated!
"Told my kids (age 8 and 6) that we were going to see the Nutcracker, which somehow got translated as the Buttcracker."
Congrats to @dmetcalf for being the first to drive a Tesla Model S over 400 miles on a single charge!
Interesting possible answer to the Fermi Paradox
Am happy to report that Tesla was narrowly cash flow positive last week. Continued improvement expected through year end.
Uranium ore now available on Amazon! So much more convenient than Uzbekistan #AwesomeXmasGifts
"Can't put my finger on it, but for some reason the newsstand is looking particularly good right now"
"But if humanity wishes to become a multi-planet species, then we must figure out how to move millions of people to Mars."
"And, yes, I do in fact know that this sounds crazy. That is not lost on me. Nor I do think SpaceX will do this alone."
